           relationship between multithreading and time slicing algo

           1. lets say we have single processor and k threads

           single processor has to deal with k threads
           - time slicing
           - processing time is shared among threads
           - thread 1 will run for small time, then thread 2 will be scheduled and so on and so forth

           huge diffrence between multithreading and parallel computing
           1. in parallel computing .. no need for time slicing
           2. for multithreading .. need !
