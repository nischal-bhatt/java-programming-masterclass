    problems with synchronization

    1. every object in java has an intrinsic lock
    2. thread will acquire object's intrinsic lock when it enters synchronized method
    3. no 2 threads can execute the same synchronized method at the same time
    4. problem is that every object only has a single monitor lock
    5. 2 INDEPENDENT synchronized methods, then threads
       have to wait for each other even though they are synchronized methods
6. usually it is not a good programming practise to make an entire method synchronized
